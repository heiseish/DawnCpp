CMake Warning (dev) at /home/heiseish/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/clion/bin/cmake/linux/x64/share/cmake-3.28/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (Protobuf)
  does not match the name of the calling package (protobuf).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
